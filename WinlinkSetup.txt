Soundmodem for raspberry pi:
https://www.cantab.net/users/john.wiseman/Documents/QtSoundModem.html
	--> this has such old libraries that is no longer supported unless you find
	qt5-default 
	libqt5serialport5
somewhere, so instead we need to use Direwolf.


Soundmodem:
Make sure your soundmodem device is plugged in through usb cable.


Use alsamixer to set the sound levels (likely if the PTT doesn't activate it's because the levels are not above 70-80%)
Direwolf will use VOX for PTT activation so this is important.
(see https://www.kevinhooke.com/tag/raspberry-pi/)


Direwolf:
sudo apt-get install direwolf

Make sure your signalink is connected to your pi by usb cable, then run:  arecord -l
you should see something like this:
**** List of CAPTURE Hardware Devices ****
card 2: CODEC [USB AUDIO  CODEC], device 0: USB Audio [USB Audio]
  Subdevices: 1/1
  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0
  
also you can use: aplay -l
which should show us something like this:
**** List of PLAYBACK Hardware Devices ****
card 0: Headphones [bcm2835 Headphones], device 0: bcm2835 Headphones [bcm2835 Headphones]
  Subdevices: 8/8
  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0
  Subdevice #1: subdevice #1
  Subdevice #2: subdevice #2
  Subdevice #3: subdevice #3
  Subdevice #4: subdevice #4
  Subdevice #5: subdevice #5
  Subdevice #6: subdevice #6
  Subdevice #7: subdevice #7
card 1: vc4hdmi [vc4-hdmi], device 0: MAI PCM i2s-hifi-0 [MAI PCM i2s-hifi-0]
  Subdevices: 1/1
  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0
card 2: CODEC [USB AUDIO  CODEC], device 0: USB Audio [USB Audio]
  Subdevices: 1/1
  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0
  
So, we can see that our audio device should be 2,0

Put direwolf config in root directory, assign call sign.

(put audio device config)
ADEVICE  plughw:2,0

Now run:
sudo addgroup direwolf audio


sudo apt-get install libax25
sudo apt-get install ax25-apps
sudo apt-get install ax25-tools

set the following in /etc/ax25/axports:

# /etc/ax25/axports
#1200 baud is used for signalink
# name	callsign	speed	paclen	window	description
ax0		KN4TEM-1	1200	255		7		2m packet radio


Now run:
sudo direwolf -t 0 -p

we should now see something like the following:
Dire Wolf version 1.6
Includes optional support for:  gpsd hamlib cm108-ptt

Reading config file direwolf.conf
Audio device for both receive and transmit: plughw:1,0  (channel 0)
Channel 0: 1200 baud, AFSK 1200 & 2200 Hz, E+, 44100 sample rate / 3.
Note: PTT not configured for channel 0. (Ignore this if using VOX.)
Ready to accept AGW client application 0 on port 8000 ...
Ready to accept KISS TCP client application 0 on port 8001 ...
Virtual KISS TNC is available on /dev/pts/2
Created symlink /tmp/kisstnc -> /dev/pts/2

Look for the last line in /dev/pts/

(may need to run below line, does this work?)
sudo kissparms -c 1 -p radio

Now in another cli, run kissattach:
sudo kissattach /dev/pts/3 ax0
sudo kissattach /tmp/kisstnc wl2k


(At the moment on this machine this is set to run on port 9001)

download pat winlink from here:
https://github.com/la5nta/pat/releases

wget https://github.com/la5nta/pat/releases/download/v0.12.1/pat_0.12.1_linux_armhf.deb
sudo dpkg -i pat_0.12.1_linux_armhf.deb

configure pat winlink (should now be installed):
pat configure
pat http -> starts webserver

set up as a service:
sudo systemctl start pat@pi   (your system username instead of pi)
sudo systemctl enable pat@pi

to reconfigure pat-winlink use:
cd ~/.config/pat
sudo nano config.json
or sudo nano ~/.config/pat/config.json

--> set like this:

"listen": [],
  "hamlib_rigs": {},
  "ax25": {
    "port": "ax0",
    "beacon": {
      "every": 3600,
      "message": "Winlink P2P",
      "destination": "IDENT"
    },
    "rig": ""
  },
